# TodoList

Concepts Covered: Basic syntax, functions, loops, conditional statements, and file I/O.

This project is a simple task management application implemented in Python. It allows users to perform the following operations:

   1. Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to the list.
   2. List Tasks: Users can view a list of all tasks along with their status (done or not done).
   3. Mark Task as Done: Users can mark a task as done from the list of tasks.
   4. Exit: Users can exit the program when they're done managing their tasks.

The project demonstrates basic functionality using lists, dictionaries, loops, conditional statements, and user input/output in Python. It provides a simple command-line interface for users to interact with the task management system.
